## Setting up the project

### Ignores
Run the file `p4setup.bat` by double-clicking it to set up the ignores. This makes sure you dont accidentally add stuff you shouldn't to the depot

### Unity
To add the project to Unity Hub, click "Open" and select the folder `Game Project 1 - Team 1`.
The version we are using is `2022.3.12f1`. Unity hub should prompt you to install if you don't have that version on your system.
